# 📦 eCrate System (React + Vite + TypeScript)

eCrate is a production-grade web application developed for managing and tracking the **crating workflow of goods** within the manufacturing environment.  
It provides real-time visibility, scheduling, and status monitoring from **queuing** → **staging** → **crating** → **completion**, ensuring every package is accurately handled and traceable from start to dispatch.

## 🧭 Overview

The system enables production and vendor teams to coordinate the entire crating process efficiently by:
- Handling serial number queuing and staging logic
- Tracking current crating sessions and statuses
- Managing area and device registration
- Handling cancellations, re-queues, and vendor handovers
- Providing auditability for every operation
